# Scrape-HW-2
For this assignment, we've created an app that will scrape a news site and populate the home page with articles from the website that is scraped. You also have the ability to save notes for each article.

> Note from Cami: Oh man. It took me a whole week to finally get a working version of this app. At first, I tried doing everything competely blind without referencing the activities. I was doing file until I got to the part where I needed to scrape the articles. I started to use the activities and video supplemental. Which kind of made it worse, because I no longer could retrieve articles. At some point, I decided to start over, which helped, because I got further, but I couldn't figure out how to get notes to work. So, I ended up starting over a third time, bsaically recreating the activity, just to get it working.

# Disclaimer

This is deployed to Heroku, but does not scrape.
